Please prepare a 1 to 2 page analysis summary answering the question below.

In order to help inform the planning for provision of cancer treatment services in NHS Borders, we would like to gain better understanding of the incidence of cancer in NHS Borders.

You will present your findings back to us during the Mock Interviews. Presentations will be 5 minutes long.



- have a look to see if top 10 varies whether you use crude, easr, wasr or sir. 

For this report WASR and EASR are irrelevant - they are only used if wanting to compare with other countries within Europe or Worldwide. As we are focusing on the incidence of cancer in the Borders alone, we can look at crude rate or number of admissions. 

However, when identifying problem areas we should take into account the SIR - it gives us a measure of whether or not the rate of incidence is expected, or if there is a problem that needs to be addressed. Equally low incidences could be due to something in place that is working?



- could look at top 10 and see if they are all increasing or decreasing over time?
- add a column which calculates the yearly increase/decrease, and find the most increasing ones??

- would it be helpful to see the top 10 cancers affecting men, and the top 10 affecting women? 

Before visualations start with key statistics:
- how many admissions per year?
- increase since 1992?
- cancer with the most number of admissions?
- in 2018, how many men and how many women?
