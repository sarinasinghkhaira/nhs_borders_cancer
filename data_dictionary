CancerSiteICD10Code	 : 	The ICD10 codes that make up the diagnosed cancer site	
CancerSite	 : 	The diagnosed cancer site	

Sex	 : 	Sex	
SexQF	 : 	Qualifier for Sex	(d = derived)

Year	 : 	Year of diagnosis. Data ranges from 1994 - 2018

IncidencesAllAges	 : 	Total number of new cancer registrations

CrudeRate	 : 	The crude rate is calculated per 100,000 person-years at risk

CrudeRateLower95pcConfidenceInterval	 : 	Lower confidence interval for the crude rate

EASR	 : 	The European age-standardised (using the 2013 European Standard Population) incidence rate per 100,000 person-years at risk	
(This is the rate that would have been found if the population of Scotland had the same age-composition (proportion of total population in each five year age class) as a hypothetical European population.

The rates are calculated by applying the age-specific rates for the location being studied to a theoretical European standard population, usually expressed per 100,000 persons per year.)

(If its higher than 100, then there are more than expected)

https://www.mass.gov/doc/appendix-a-explanation-of-a-standardized-incidence-ratio-sir-and-95-confidence-interval-0/download : this states that the 95 CI should not include 100, if they do then its not statistically different from the mean. If there are fewer than 5 cases then it make sense not to calculate the SIR. Also if the 95 CI range is too wide (85-450) then its too unstable to really report

3.  Confidence intervals for age- and sex-standardised rates (EASR and WASR) have been calculated using a formula which works only when numbers are sufficiently large.  They are therefore set to 'not applicable' in the event of there being fewer than 20 cases.
